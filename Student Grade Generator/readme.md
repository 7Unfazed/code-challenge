## Introduction
For this code challenge, i'm expected to write a program that prompts the user to input student marks. The input should be between 0 and 100. Then output the correct grade: 
A > 79, B - 60 to 79, C -  49 to 59, D - 40 to 49, E - less 40.
## How to Use
1. Make sure you have node.js installed in your system
2. Navigate to the index.js file
3. Run the program by typing node index.js on the terminal
4. Follow the prompt to input his/her marks
## Implementation Details
The program uses the prompt-sync library to prompt the user for input.
Conditional statements (if-else if) are used to determine the grade based on the input mark.
